# Admin-Dashboard
Used react.js to build this admin dashboard project,and used node.js,express for the backend.
the UI part of the project is completed and the backend is still under implementation , using mongoDB.
in this project before visiting the dashbard you should have to login using your username and password, so the authotication will be done by the node.js after getting the request from frontend.
after loging in you will be able to see your dashboard with a search icon, your name, notification  and your photo in the header part.
in the sidenav you can see the components like dashboard, account,productlist, addproduct and signout option.
so inside each component you will have sub components and contents.
in **Dashboard** you can your stats, skills which will be represented graphicaly for those charts i used **react-rechart**.
in **Accounts** component you will have 2 options 
            1.)edit profile.
            2.)change password.
in **productslist** component you can see list of products .
in **Addproducts** component you can add new components to the productslist.
finaly the **Signout** option , so if you click on it and refresht he page then you should again login .

During the project I used **React-Rechart** , which is a library whcih is build specificaly for react.js .

I also used **material UI** that is a well know react component library, it has collection of  many prebuilt components , 
which can be used by us directly by importing it into out files.

I also used **figma** for the template , figma is used mainly for design and is also have many colaborative user interface designs.

**HAPPY LEARNING GUYS**
